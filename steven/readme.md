### The Genetics of TH17 Signaling Cytokines: Interleukin-23 and Interleukin-17A
* 12/06/2019: Steve find the validation raw data saved in `/mnt/bigdata/StudyData/SCH10411/SecondStage/`
* 12/06/2019: Merge with exome1 and exom2 and check the [IT-Remapped id](SCH101411_Crosswalk.csv) again 
* 12/06/2019: Michigan imputation completed and saved `~/hpc/project/pmrp/cytokine/michigan`
* 12/05/2019: Update cytokine data from hg18 to hg19 so that we can doimputation and phasing with Michigan-Server.
* [ID updated](SCH101411_Crosswalk.csv) (12/05/2019): IT department provided wrong ID information and I found them when QC 
* Steven show the raw `illumina 660W (hg18)`data ((12/03/2019)): `/mnt/bigdata/Genetic/Projects/Schrodi_TH17`
* [588 samples](overlapSample.txt) were repeated genotyped in phase 1 and phase 2 by this sample id
* GWAS raw data were saved in `/mnt/bigdata/Genetic/Projects/Harold/GWAS_data_merge`
